				At KRB Foundation, we believe every child deserves more than just a classroom—they deserve a community that nurtures their potential and empowers their future. That’s why we’re committed to
				providing safe, inclusive, and enriching after-school environments where youth can thrive intellectually, socially, and emotionally.
			</p>
			<p class="text-gray-500 text-xl mb-6 lg:mb-12">
				Our programs—ranging from STEAM exploration and chess club to life skills workshops—are thoughtfully designed to spark curiosity, build confidence, and equip young people with the tools they
				need to succeed in life. We focus our efforts in communities where access to quality enrichment is limited.
			</p>
			<p class="text-gray-500 text-xl">
				By closing educational gaps and fostering meaningful mentorship, we provide more than just activities—we create safe spaces for growth, connection, and opportunity. Behind every program is a
				dedicated team of educators, mentors, and volunteers who believe in the power of youth. With a deep commitment to equity, inclusion, and community-driven impact, we’re shaping tomorrow’s
				leaders—one child at a time.
